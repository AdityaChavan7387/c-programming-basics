# C Programming Basics 🧠💻

This repository contains my **basic C language programs**, created while revisiting and strengthening my fundamentals in programming.

The goal of this repository is to build a **strong foundation in C**, focusing on logic, syntax, and core concepts such as input/output, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.
